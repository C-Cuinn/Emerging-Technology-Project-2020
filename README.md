This project is to produce a python webservice that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in a data set. This program should be able to take in a wind speed value and through machine learning train a model that is used to output a prediction of the amount of power generated. 

To run : 

λ set FLASK_APP=prediction.py

λ python -m flask run

✬ It will run on at this address http://127.0.0.1:5000/


### This repository contains :

✬ powergeneration.ipynb, The main project file.

✬ Dockerfile, Contains commands required by docker to run the container.

✬ powerproduction.csv, The dataset we are working with.

✬ prediction.py, Contains the routes required for webapp functionality.

✬ README, What you are currently reading.

✬ requirements.txt, the import needed by the program in order to be able to run.
